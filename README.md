## Description
This is a database used to store user-submitted works of speculative fiction (i.e. works of science fiction, fantasy, etc.) and sort them by user-submitted tags (e.g. "science fiction", "fantasy", etc.).  A user must log in with Google to submit either a new tag or a new publication, or add a new review/description of a publication or add new tags to it.

## Try it out
Go to **(this link)[https://speculative-fiction.onrender.com]** to view the database.  Try submitting your own publication and add a description and appropriate tags (requires login with Google).  If you want to add a tag you don't see, make your own!
